Someone brought [We're Not Really Strangers](https://www.werenotreallystrangers.com/) to a friend's housewarming, and we tried it. I was skeptical after seeing it [played on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1064874264) (seek to about nine minutes in), but it was fine.

I happened to draw a card for everyone else to recommend me a book, so here's the resulting book list:
