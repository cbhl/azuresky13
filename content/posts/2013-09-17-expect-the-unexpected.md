EtU <=> CardCaptors

Last night, I ran into someone I knew who I hadn't seen in a very long time.
- after velocity demo
- riding the bus late at night
- wasn't expecting anything special to happen, and then, hey, look who walks on the bus

Her hair was faded pink.
- volunteered for orientation week
- was all gung-ho but underwhelmed; she ended up floating for most of O-week

- taking humanities courses this term (linguistics and stuff)

- living by McCormick

- had a pleasant conversation

- living in Waterloo; my first co-op term here
