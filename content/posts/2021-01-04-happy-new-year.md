I was using [this 80 cm x 39.4 cm study table](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FZ5FZPZ) before, but discovered it is inconvenient to do Android development without a space to leave a development device attached to your setup. (I mean, if I was only going to be using it for a few months, why rearrange my whole apartment? Ha, ha.)

So now I'm trying a [folding corner desk](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B082NY2LZW) and a 25" USB-C monitor.

I mean, sure, I could spend ~$1000 on a motorized standing desk, but I already have a counter-height table... I guess we'll see in another 9 months.
