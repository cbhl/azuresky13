Also to anyone who did well, don't fail the final. This is a bad time to decide you can start partying all day, err'y day.


To the student who was complaining about his roommate:
1. One midterm grade isn't the entirety of your knowledge state. Maybe your roommate is good at Physics and bad at CS, for example.
2. Some degree of social interaction is expected in undergrad. For many people, university is where you will meet "best friends for life", learn how to interact with people of the opposite gender, etc.
3. Assuming that you've been paying attention in lecture, and doing all the assignments, and don't have any swiss-cheese gaps in your education, two hours is a lot of time to spend studying on one course. A key aspect of learning is "spaced repetition" -- you have to force yourself to recall things from memory when you're on the verge of forgetting them. Cramming for ten hours the night before might help you pass the exam, but it probably won't help you learn.
4. Content in 1A and 1B will be review for some students; a lot of the curriculum in first year just covers fundamentals to deal with inconsistencies in high school education. Many students fail 1B or 2A exams because they don't develop good study habits and don't realize there's a problem until after they fail their exams in 1B or 2A.
5. An upper-year told me that grades tend to either "start high, go up a bit, and then start falling" or "start low, fall a bit, but rise consistently term after term". If grades matter to you, then hard work and effective study habits will help a lot.
6. If you are actually experiencing difficulties with course material, please ask for help. Ask your classmates to help you with the assignments. Actually do the assignments. Visit your TAs and Professor during office hours (and/or set up an appointment by e-mail) to clarify things you don't understand. Try reading the textbook (if any) or finding alternate resources (other textbooks at the library, or Khan Academy, or other online resources). There's lots of help available if your need it.
7. At the end of the day, grades are just a number. Passing your courses is a good idea, but there are a lot of other important things in life. Find good friends and work hard to keep them; learn about things that interest you; eat food that's healthy and food that tastes good (not necessarily the same food). If you get struck by a bus tomorrow, you're probably not going to think, "oh, if only I had spent an extra hour studying for ECE 105".

If he is as good as you say, he is probably very, very bored right now. And he probably will be for the next couple of years. And that sucks in its own way. One of my friends partied a lot in 1A and 1B, and while he passed his exams, some of the people he partied with did not. As far as I know, he's felt guilty ever since, and, on top of that, he had to make new friends in 2A.

For you, I'd focus on improvement. What do you know now that you didn't know two months ago? If you're learning, then that's something worth celebrating. I think that's true whether you have a 60 average or a 95 average.
