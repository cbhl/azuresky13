<ul>
	<li>Entrepreneurship is about more than just start-ups. Think about the girl in Civil Engineering selling organic fruits and vegetables.</li>
	<li>Most businesses fail. A "Calling and Copy Center"? Seriously?</li>
	<li>Hackathon funding is almost completely driven by externalities. Recruiters. Venture Capitalists. For-profit hackathons.</li>
	<li>Your master plan should never include "Win $HACKATHON" as a step. n-1 of you will fail.</li>
	<li>Use hackathons correctly to achieve your goals. Use it as a chance to spend the weekend working yourself to near-death with your significant other, or to motivate you to just start.</li>
	<li>Money isn't enough. You need [customers](http://mikekirkup.com/2013/06/10/what-it-really-means-for-a-community-to-support-startups/).</li>
	<li>Find your [tennis ball](http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2013/commencement-address-houston-0607.html). If you really want to build a business to solve X, you'll take that 10% hit to your GPA.</li>
	<li>Hurray for Policy 73.</li>
