- Aside: One of the things I hate about switching to nanoc: like OctoPress, the
  title is embedded in the filename, and you have to set one when you invoke
  rake new_post["title"]. I find it is best to title a post after you write it,
  but I also find it hard to rename posts atm.

# On Gifts

- Gifts used to be easy.

- Assumption: People enjoy receiving gifts.
- Evidence: Mother's Day Gifts.
- Evidence: Valentine's Day Cards.

- Assumption: You should do kind things for other people.
- Evidence: Pay it Forward
- Evidence: Justin Bieber Music Video (FIXME)

- Conclusion: Giving gifts is a kind thing, and I should do it.

- Unintended consequence: Some people don't want to accept gifts from me / don't feel comfortable accepting gifts from me.
    - Valentine's Day Cards \w Chocolate in High School
    - Pokemon
    - That koala bear Winnie got

- Anecdote: Gift Exchange, 6th grade. Other student doesn't remember to bring
  gift for me. Once I find out what it is, I remark, "oh, that's okay, I don't
  like digimon anyway." The next day, I end up with a partially used Scooby-Doo
  branded marker set. What happened?
  - Possible explanation: Other student regifted his gift to make me feel
    better, in response to the feedback I gave him about his gift of choice
    being unwanted.

- Anecdote: I used to prefer cash presents, so I could pool them and buy
  something bigger for myself. Then, I get an ice cream cake for my 23rd
  birthday, and it makes me happy. What happened?
  - Surprise!

- I still dislike chocolate cake
  - taste of cardboard
  - my 21st birthday

Gifts are hard. Part of me wishes I could just send $10-20/month off to some
mystical service and have it all magically work out with my friends. Social
obligations of returning gifts and so forth. And people don't put their
birthdays on Facebook!

I need a better memorable statement.

lappi, if you change your mind about Pokemon X, the offer is still open.
